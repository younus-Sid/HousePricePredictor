## About HousePricePredictor
- This machine learning project involves predicting prices of house.
- The model is build using Linear Regression Algorithm.
- The price is predicted on the basis of "Locality", "Total Area", "BHK" and "Bathroom".
- Usually we predict prices in a particular city but with this project one can predict prices in THREE different cities.
- These cities are "Bangalore", "Delhi" and "Pune".
- To be honest, the model predicts the prices quiet nicely but sometimes it makes weird predictions and so I am still working on it to make it better.
